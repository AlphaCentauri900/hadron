<div class="text"><p id="none">.</p><p>Scientists at the Large Hadron Collider just observed light spectrum of antimatter for the first time – and it’s main goal is to open a gateway into Hell, according to internet maniacs.</p>

<p>In fact, the scientists are actually building the kingdom of the antichrist – and soon he’ll step through to rule our planet, according to blogger Christian Truther.</p>

<p>The site says, ‘Antimatter is the opposite of matter, it isn’t physical, it’s spiritual, and it’s all around us. It’s also quite elusive and chaotic.”</p>

<p>‘As the machines are able to trap and contain chaotic antimatter, they are able to study it, bringing them one step closer to manifesting it physically.’</p>

<p>‘They see themselves as god on earth and think that their actions are replicated by a god in ‘heaven.’ CERN is building the kingdom of the antichrist, hell on earth’.’</p>

<p>It’s all preposterous rubbish, of course – based on misreading press releases, and deliberately misunderstanding what scientists are saying.</p>

<p>In September 2015, conspiracy theorists widely predicted that the Large Hadron Collider would be involved in the end of the world – either by summoning an asteroid, or the Antichrist himself.</p>

<p>Far from seeking to kill us all, the scientists at CERN hope that discoveries from the tunnels could actually change the world.</p>
